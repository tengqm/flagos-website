# Introduction

DeepSeek-R1-FlagOS-NVIDIA-BF16 provides an all-in-one deployment solution, enabling execution of DeepSeek-R1 on Nvidia GPUs. As the first-generation release for the NVIDIA-H100 series, this package delivers three key features:

1. Comprehensive Integration:
   - Integrated with FlagScale (https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagScale).
   - Open-source inference execution code, preconfigured with all necessary software and hardware settings.
   - Verified model files, available on Hugging Face ([Model Link](https://huggingface.co/FlagRelease/DeepSeek-R1-FlagOS-Nvidia-BF16)).
   - Pre-built Docker image for rapid deployment on NVIDIA-H100.
2. High-Precision BF16 Checkpoints:
   - BF16 checkpoints dequantized from the official DeepSeek-R1 FP8 model to ensure enhanced inference accuracy and performance.
3. Consistency Validation:
   - Evaluation tests verifying consistency of results between the official and ours.

# Technical Summary

## Serving Engine

We use FlagScale as the serving engine to improve the portability of distributed inference.

FlagScale is an end-to-end framework for large models across multiple chips, maximizing computational resource efficiency while ensuring model effectiveness. It ensures both ease of use and high performance for users when deploying models across different chip architectures:

- One-Click Service Deployment: FlagScale provides a unified and simple command execution mechanism, allowing users to fast deploy services seamlessly across various hardware platforms using the same command. This significantly reduces the entry barrier and enhances user experience.
- Automated Deployment Optimization: FlagScale automatically optimizes distributed parallel strategies based on the computational capabilities of different AI chips, ensuring optimal resource allocation and efficient utilization, thereby improving overall deployment performance.
- Automatic Operator Library Switching: Leveraging FlagScale's unified Runner mechanism and deep integration with FlagGems, users can seamlessly switch to the FlagGems operator library for inference by simply adding environment variables in the configuration file.

## Triton Support

We validate the execution of DeepSeed-R1 model with a Triton-based operator library as a PyTorch alternative.

We use a variety of Triton-implemented operation kernels—approximately 70%—to run the DeepSeek-R1 model. These kernels come from two main sources:

- Most Triton kernels are provided by FlagGems (https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagGems). You can enable FlagGems kernels by setting the environment variable USE_FLAGGEMS. For more details, please refer to the "How to Run Locally" section.

- Also included are Triton kernels from vLLM, including fused MoE.

## BF16 Dequantization

We provide dequantized model weights in bfloat16 to run DeepSeek-R1 on NVIDIA GPUs, along with adapted configuration files and tokenizer.
