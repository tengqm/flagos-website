# Course Platform and Online Laboratory Environment
## FlagOS Intelligent Computing System Software Stack
The laboratory environment for this course is built on the FlagOS Intelligent Computing System Software Stack. Developed by the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI), FlagOS is a unified open-source heterogeneous computing software stack designed for diverse computing architectures, enabling a "develop once, run on multiple chips, deploy everywhere" paradigm. FlagOS comprises several core components, including:
FlagScale：A distributed training/inference framework supporting large model training and deployment across heterogeneous hardware
FlagGems：A general-purpose operator library consisting of high-performance AI operators implemented in the Triton language
FlagTree：A unified compiler supporting Triton compilation for multiple AI chip backends
FlagCX：A cross-chip communication library supporting high-performance collective communication in heterogeneous computing environments
All laboratory tasks, including Triton kernel development, operator optimization, MLIR pass implementation, and distributed training deployment, will be carried out within the FlagOS ecosystem.
## Online Laboratory
The course provides a cloud-based online laboratory platform. Students can remotely access GPU computing resources through a web browser to complete all course experiments without configuring a local GPU environment.
Platform Registration and Login:
After the semester begins, the instructor will set up online laboratory accounts for all enrolled students. Please access the platform at the following URL:
Online Laboratory Portal: https://flagos.io/OnlineLab
Once your account is activated, you will be allocated GPU computing resources and can write, run, and debug code directly online. Please use computing time responsibly and avoid occupying resources for extended periods without releasing them.
Platform Usage Guide:
For detailed documentation on the online laboratory platform (environment setup, experiment submission procedures, FAQs, etc.), please refer to:
Platform Documentation: https://docs.flagos.io/projects/onlinelaboratory/en/latest/onlinelaboratory.html
Students are advised to carefully read the above documentation before the first experiment to familiarize themselves with the basic workflow. If you encounter technical issues, please consult the documentation first, then seek help through the course discussion forum or Office Hours.
Important Notes:
The computing resources on the online laboratory platform are exclusively for course experiments. Do not use them for personal projects unrelated to the course.
Please save your code and data locally in a timely manner after completing experiments, as platform instances may be periodically reclaimed.
If resources are unavailable during peak hours, please schedule your work during off-peak times and plan your experiment schedule accordingly.

# Laboratory Assignments
The course includes 4 module-based laboratory assignments, each corresponding to one of the four core modules. Each assignment contains both basic tasks and advanced tasks—basic tasks verify your understanding of core principles, while advanced tasks encourage exploratory optimization. All experiments are to be completed on the FlagOS online laboratory platform.
A brief description of each experiment is as follows:
Lab 1 · Softmax Kernel: Implement a Softmax kernel using Triton. The code must pass numerical accuracy tests, and an experiment report describing the implementation approach must be submitted.
Lab 2 · Operator Fusion: Implement a fused RMSNorm + Residual Connection operator. Performance must reach at least 90% of the baseline implementation. Submit the code along with a performance comparison report.
Lab 3 · MLIR Pass Implementation: Write a simple MLIR optimization pass to implement Conv+BN fusion. The pass must pass all test cases. Submit the code along with a description of the optimization results.
Lab 4 · Distributed Training: Deploy distributed training of a 7B-parameter model in a multi-GPU environment. Record throughput, linear scaling efficiency, and GPU memory utilization data.
Please plan your time wisely and start experiments early—debugging and optimization of programming tasks often take longer than expected. If you encounter difficulties, make good use of Office Hours and the course discussion forum.

# Course Project
A comprehensive course project is assigned at the end of the semester (individual or team-based; teams of 2–3 members are recommended). You are required to conduct performance analysis and optimization on a specific AI operator or system software module, and present your design approach, experimental data, and performance improvement results in a defense presentation.
The project is divided into two phases:
Design Proposal (Midterm): Submit a topic selection report presenting the project background, algorithmic approach, and preliminary experimental progress.
Final Deliverables (End of Term): Submit a complete code repository and technical report. Present the final implementation results and performance benchmarking data in a defense presentation.

# Examination
The course includes one final examination covering all course content. The exam consists of multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, and short-answer/analytical questions, with an emphasis on assessing your understanding of core concepts and your ability to apply the knowledge learned to solve practical engineering problems.
The exam is a closed-book written test. The specific date and location will be announced separately.

# Grading Policy
Your final grade is composed of the following three weighted components:

| Assessment Component | Weight | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lab Assignments (4) | 40% | Each of the four module experiments accounts for 10%, graded on code correctness, performance, and experiment report quality |
| Course Project | 30% | Design proposal accounts for 9%, final deliverables for 21%; grading dimensions include performance improvement, implementation quality, report, and defense presentation |
| Final Examination | 30% | Multiple-choice: 30 pts + Fill-in-the-blank: 20 pts + Short-answer/Analytical: 50 pts |

# Getting Help
If you encounter problems during your studies, there are several ways to get help:
Office Hours: The instructor and teaching assistants hold Q&A sessions during designated time slots; see the course homepage for the specific schedule. For more in-depth questions, it is recommended to schedule an appointment via email in advance.

# Collaboration and Academic Integrity
We encourage communication and collaboration among students—forming study groups and discussing problem-solving approaches are excellent learning methods. However, please observe the following principles:
You may freely discuss ideas and approaches for experiments and assignments, but each student must independently complete and submit their own code and report.
If your problem-solving approach benefited from discussions with others or public resources, please include an acknowledgment in your report.
Plagiarism of others' code or reports is prohibited, as is submitting solutions directly generated by AI tools without proper understanding and modification.
For team-based course projects, the report must clearly specify each member's division of labor and contributions.
